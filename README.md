Hi there, you might know me as Kurin, I've decided to undertake the task of digitizing and compiling all of Oratory1990's and Resolve's measurements here!

I extracted all of Oratory's measurements from the https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/tree/master/measurements/oratory1990/data repository. As for Resolve's measurements I scoured the web for any place where he's uploaded measurements (Headphones.com discord, Headphones.com forums, Headphones Show YouTube channel, @ResolveReviews on Twitter, etc) and traced them manually.

I didn't include any tilted DF targets but you can tilt any target or measurement using the guide in: How to tilt targets.png 

Thank you for checking out this Drive, feel free to share it as you please!

If you come across any issues, have any questions you'd like to ask or have measurements you'd like for me to add, consider joining my Discord server and have a chat with me (@kurincc) and the rest of the community! https://discord.gg/cubUsUbyZp
